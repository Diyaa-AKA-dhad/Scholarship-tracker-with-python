# 🎓 Scholarship Tracker Pro

**Your Simple Application Sidekick**

Hey there! 👋 I originally built this small desktop application to keep my own scholarship applications organized, and decided to share it in case it helps others as well. It is a straightforward tool designed to track all essential details—titles, links, and application statuses—in one tidy place.

If you are a student juggling multiple applications, or a developer looking for a compact project to extend, this tool is for you.

## ✨ Features

Scholarship Tracker Pro is intentionally simple, yet effective:

- **Simple GUI** — Built with `customtkinter` for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- **Local Storage** — All data is saved locally in a `scholarships.json` file.
- **Quick Links** — Use the **Open** button to instantly visit a scholarship website.
- **Full Control** — Add new entries, edit existing ones, or delete outdated applications.
- **Status Tracking** — Record notes such as *Applied*, *Pending Review*, or *Accepted*.
